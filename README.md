# Sales Forecasting App using Codeigniter 3 HMVC + Bootstrap 5

This application is made using the PHP programming language with the Codeigniter 3 framework modified into a Hierarchical model-view-controller (HMVC). This application will predict sales or targets that will be obtained in the future from existing datasets. This application utilizes the Least Squares method, a linear model that uses the least squares method to approach the solution.

This application was created as a final semester exam project. If there are imperfections in this application, I am ready to accept suggestions so that this project can be better in the future.
