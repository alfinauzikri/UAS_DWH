# Sales Forecasting App using LeastSquares Linear Regression

This application is made using the **PHP** programming language with the **Codeigniter 3** framework which has been modified into a **Hierarchical model-view-controller (HMVC)**. This application will predict sales or targets that will be obtained in the future from existing datasets. This application utilizes the **Least Squares** method, a linear model that uses the least squares method to approach the solution.

_This application was created as a final semester exam project. If there are shortcomings in this application, I am ready to hear suggestions from you._
